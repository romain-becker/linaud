# Features 
## CPU 
### PAE 
Enable PAE/NX: Determines whether the PAE and NX capabilities of the host CPU will be exposed to the virtual machine. PAE stands for Physical Address Extension. Normally, if enabled and supported by the OS, then even a 32-bit x86 CPU can access more than 4 GB of RAM. For Intel CPUs, the option is grayed out.
### NX 
The NX bit (no-execute) is a technology used in CPUs to segregate areas of memory for use by either storage of processor instructions (code) or for storage of data, a feature normally only found in Harvard architecture processors.

## GRUB 
### /etc/grub.d 

### /boot.grub

### GRUB password 
It is recommended to set a password for GRUB with `grub-md5-crypt`

### IOMMU 
Activating the IOMMU service protects the systemâ€™s memory from being arbitrary accessed by
devices. 
The iommu=force directive must be added to the list of kernel parameters during
startup in addition to those already present in the configuration files of the boot-
loader (/boot/grub/menu.lst or /etc/default/grub).

## KERNEL 
### Dynamic loading of kernel modules 

### Yama securoty module 

### Magic SysRq key 

### Sysctl
